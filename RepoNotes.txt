main.py
The codes in the python file are not mine but, from a tutorial, as part of my research.
Below is the analysis of the overall code:

Chatbots main framework:
1) Create knowledge base from a JSON file
2) Save dictionary to knowledge base
3) Database of historical questions and answers that are updated in real-time
4) Finding best match from dictionary
5) Function to answer each question
6) Chatbot function

The chatbot is able to catalogue past conversations between bot and user, in the JSON file
When opening the chatbot again, the chatbot would withdraw from the JSON file
The chatbot learns new responses by prompting the user to teach it.
