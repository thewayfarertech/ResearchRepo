------ Introduction --------
This textfile summarises the content in the Github Repository, my own codes, inspiring codes, interesting and confusing concepts and a summary. 
As part of the assignment requirements, I have done looked at few tutorials on how chatbots are created. 
Chatbots range from text-only or more complex verions have also integrated AI abilities.

The analysis is done on one of the chatbot tutorials that I selected. 
The Python script and JSON files in the PythonScriptChatbot.py and knowledge_base.json, respectively, are not created by me. 


All the files can be found in my GitHub Repository, namely:
1. PythonScriptChatbot.py
2. knowledge_base.json
3. RepoNotes.txt





------ My Own Codes --------




------ Inspiring Codes --------
The codes in the python and JSON files came from this tutorial: 
Source:["How To Build A Chat Bot That Learns From The User In Python Tutorial"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkkjXTER2KE&t=187s&ab_channel=Indently)





------ Interesting or Confusing Concepts --------





------ Summary --------



Chatbots main framework:
1) Create knowledge base from a JSON file
2) Save dictionary to knowledge base
3) Database of historical questions and answers that are updated in real-time
4) Finding best match from dictionary
5) Function to answer each question
6) Chatbot function

The chatbot is able to catalogue past conversations between bot and user, in the JSON file
When opening the chatbot again, the chatbot would withdraw from the JSON file
The chatbot learns new responses by prompting the user to teach it.
